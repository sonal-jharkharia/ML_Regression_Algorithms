This repository contains examples of linear and logistic regression.

<b>1) Simple_Linear_Regression_Gradient_Descent_Boston_Dataset</b>

The housing price prediction is done using a univariate feature based on a correlation of all features given in the Boston House price prediction dataset available   in the ScikitLearn library. Gradient Descent is used to minimize error and reach the global minima for the model. The loss function used is 'Mean Squared Error'.

<b>2) Multivariate_Linear_Regression_GD_Boston </b>

The housing price prediction is done using a multiple feature selected based on a correlation of all features given in the Boston House price prediction dataset available  in the ScikitLearn library. Gradient Descent is used to minimize error and reach the global minima for the model. The loss function used is 'Mean Squared Error'. The score is calculated using 'R-square'. A comparitive analysis is done for single vs multiple feature usage. Adjusted R-square is also calculated.
